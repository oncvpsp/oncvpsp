			MODEL CORE CHARGE

    Release 3.2.3 changed modcore2.f90 and modcore3.f90.  See the release
notes for details.

    Releases prior to 3.2.1 had the option of including a model core charge
to give a "non-linear core correction" in the spirit of Louie, Froyen, and
Cohen.[1]  The functional form was actually a polynomial model allowing
greater continuity at or near the core-valence charge "crossover" following,
more or less, Fuchs and Scheffler.[2]

    Model core charges often produce convergence problems, especially  with
phonon calculations and violations of the acoustic sum rule at Gamma.  An
alternative approach to the LFC non-linearity argument was introduced by
Teter.[3]  He proposed that the 2nd derivatives of the exchange-correlation
energy with respect to the occupations of the valence states, known in the
chemical literature as the "hardness," was an important metric.  He
stated that a model core charge should be adjusted to optimize the rms
agreement of these 2nd derivatives calculated for pseudopotential atoms
and all-electron atoms.  In addition, he proposed a functional form for
such a model core charge designed to have good convergence properties
in Fourier space.  This function was used in some pseudopotentials
packaged with the ABINIT code [4}, and some tabulated on that web site.
It  does not appear that the "Teter metric" was actually used in the
generation of these potentials [5].  Routines gg1cc.f90, gp1cc.f90, and 
gpp1cc.f90 to calculate  this function and its first two derivatives have 
been adapted from ABINIT.

    Since ONCVPSP can include shallow core states as valence while
maintaining acceptable connvergence, the model-core corrections are
often unnecessary.  In addition, if inner cores are modeled, the shallow-
core charge at the crossover may be significantly different from that
of the all-electron atom, so the 'non-linearity" correction may not be
the only issue.  Teter 2nd-derivative calculations of Exc are now
included, with 4 options specified by the input variable icmod.

    To my knowledge there is no systematic evidence that "Teter hardness
metric" accuracy correlates with improved agreement between all-electron
and pseudopotential results. Its use to tune oncvpsp potentials should be 
regarded as experimental.

Model core options:

icmod==0:
    No core correction as usual.

icmod==1:
    The previous polynomial continuation of the all-electron core density
    to the origin, performed at a radius at which the core charge is
    the fcfact times the valence pseudocharge.  fcfact is typically chosen
    to be less than 1, eg. 0.25-0.5.  Exc 2nd derivatives are calculated 
    with and without this charge, and the rms discripancies reported in the
    *.out file, but play no active role.  This option is executed by 
    modcore.f90.

icmod==2:
    Amplitude and scale of the Teter function are adjusted to fit the
    value and slope of the all-electron rhoc at the radius determined
    as by fcfact as above.  This function is smoothly blended into the
    all-electron rhoc between this radius and that of the first zero
    of the Teter function (dimensionless argmument = 1.5).  This
    ensures proper unscreening in the tail region and continuity of
    at least 4 derivatives, using the function fcrossover.f90.  This is
    in the spirit of LFC [1] but significantly improves convergence.
    The "before and after" Exc 2nd derivatives are computed but not
    used.  Amplitude and scale parameters consistent with options 3 and 4
    below are given in the out file.  This option is executed by modcore2.f90

icmod==3
    The amlitude and scale parameters for the Teter function are taken
    from the input file, with the fcfact input re-interpreted and the
    rcfact argument added as follows:
 
# MODEL CORE CHARGE
# icmod, fcfact, rcfact 
    3    5.0  1.3
    
    These parameters are defined consisently with option 4 below.  They
    are also given the the out  files of options 2 and 4 as " amplitude 
    prefactor, scale prefactor."  Note that "fcfact" in this context
    has a DIFFERENT MEANING than in options 1 and 2.  Blending to the 
    all-electron rhoc is done as in option 2 above.  Exc 2nd derivatives 
    are computed but not used.  This option is executed by modcore3.f90.

icmod==4
    The "blended" Teter function parameters are optimized to reduce Exc 
    2nd-derivative discrepancies in rhomod3.f90.  The optimization is
    initiated by finding the radius rmatch at which rhoc=pseudo-rho, and
    this charge value is stored as rhocmatch.  The core model is then

         rhomod(rr)=(fcfact*rhocmatch)*F_Teter(rr/(rcfact*rmatch))

    with blending applied.  Exc 2nd derivatives are then computed on a
    coarse grid of plausible fcfact and rcfact values, the rms error
    is printed as a matrix in the out file.  The minimum on this grid
    is then refined using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm.  This option 
    is now used by tests/data/40_Zr.dat, and an annotated version of the 
    relevant section of tests/refs/40_Zr.out follows this text.  A 1-2 
    order-of-magntude reduction of the rms error is often obtained.
    However, the minimization may converge to yield a wildly implausalbe
    model, or may not converge.  An local minimum on the initial grid
    may be selected and used as input in option 3 above.
